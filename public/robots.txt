# This is a robots.txt file, which is used to communicate with web crawlers and other automated agents about which pages or parts of a website they should access or avoid.
# The file specifies rules for crawlers using the "User-agent" field, and allows the website owner to permit or deny access to specific sections of the site using the "Disallow" field.
# In this particular example, the rule "User-agent: *" applies to all crawlers, and "Disallow:" indicates that there are no restrictions for any crawler on this site.
